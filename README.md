# Volatility Prediction

Options traders rely heavily on their estimates of future volatility to guide their decisions. A successful predictive model has proven to be highly profitable. The traditional approach to volatility prediction involves an autoregressive model such as GARCH. Nevertheless, such an approach's accuracy is limited due to the inflexibility of the model to describe complex patterns in the financial market. In this research, we applied various machine learning algorithms such as XGBoost and RNN to forecast volatility. Experiment results based on historical stock data of S&P 500, Dow Jones, and Nasdaq have showcased significant improvements in model performance from using modern machine learning than the traditional econometrics approach.

In this project, we implemented three approach to volatility prediction:
1. Baseline Econometric Method: GARCH
2. Boosting Method: XGBoost
3. Recurrent Neural Network : LSTM & GRU

Our research paper is also included in the repo.
